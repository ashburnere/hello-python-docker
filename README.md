Sample of a Python webapp dockerized as decribed in [https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/).

The *dockefile* creates an images which is based on python:2.7-slim and runs a simple web app the uses the Flask framework to run. Port 80 is exposed to make the web app available to the world outside the container.

The application code is located in the file *app.py*. The dependencies are listed in file *requirements.txt*.

The events like startup and visit count are logged to the file *app.log* inside the container for testing purposes. 

The image is also published at [https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/ashburnere/hello-python-docker](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/ashburnere/hello-python-docker).


## Build the image

To build the image use
`docker build --tag=friendlyhello .`

Use `docker image ls` to see the image in your local repository.

## Build the app
To run the app in background and make it available at port 4000 at your local machine (e.g. http://localhost:4000/) use
`docker run -d -p 4000:80 friendlyhello`

Use `docker ps` or `docker ls` or `docker ls -a` to explore the containers in your system.
Use `docker start <container id>` to start a container.
Use `docker stop <container id>` to stop a container.

## Useful Docker commands
Here is a list of the basic Docker commands from this page, and some related ones if youâ€™d like to explore a bit before moving on.

- `docker build -t friendlyhello .`  # Create image using this directory's Dockerfile
- `docker run -p 4000:80 friendlyhello`  # Run "friendlyname" mapping port 4000 to 80
- `docker run -d -p 4000:80 friendlyhello`         # Same thing, but in detached mode
- `docker container ls`                                # List all running containers
- `docker container ls -a`             # List all containers, even those not running
- `docker container stop <hash>`          # Gracefully stop the specified container
- `docker container kill <hash>`         # Force shutdown of the specified container
- `docker container rm <hash>`        # Remove specified container from this machine
- `docker container rm $(docker container ls -a -q)`         # Remove all containers
- `docker image ls -a`                             # List all images on this machine
- `docker image rm <image id>`            # Remove specified image from this machine
- `docker image rm $(docker image ls -a -q)`   # Remove all images from this machine
- `docker login`             # Log in this CLI session using your Docker credentials
- `docker tag <image> username/repository:tag`  # Tag <image> for upload to registry
- `docker push username/repository:tag`            # Upload tagged image to registry
- `docker run username/repository:tag`                   # Run image from a registry
- `docker start <container id>` 	# Start container
- `docker stop <container id>` 	# Stop container
- `docker exec -it <container id>` /bin/sh	# Open shell in running container
- `docker rmi friendlyhello`	# Remove image with name friendlyhello
